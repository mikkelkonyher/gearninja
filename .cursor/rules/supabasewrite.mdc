# Overview

Regarding my Supabase MCP connection: You are allowed to perform read operations freely. However, for any WRITE, UPDATE, DELETE, or DROP operations, you MUST present the intended SQL/action in the chat and wait for my explicit confirmation before executing. When in doubt, provide the SQL code for manual execution instead.

Always use the MCP get_schema or equivalent tool before suggesting changes to ensure SQL accuracy.
